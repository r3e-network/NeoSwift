## 🏗️ New Security Infrastructure

### Core Security Classes:
```swift
// Secure memory management
SecureBytes(sensitiveData)

// Secure key handling  
SecureECKeyPair.createEcKeyPair()

// Constant-time operations
ConstantTime.areEqual(hash1, hash2)

// Performance optimizations
HashCache.shared.maxCacheSize = 5000
BinaryWriter.optimized()
```

### Test Infrastructure:
```
Tests/NeoSwiftTests/
├── integration/
│   ├── IntegrationTestBase.swift
│   └── WalletIntegrationTests.swift
├── unit/crypto/
│   └── SecurityTests.swift
└── unit/resources/
    └── test-credentials.json
```

## 🚀 How to Use the Release

### For New Projects:
```swift
// Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/crisogray/NeoSwift", from: "2.0.0")

// Secure usage
let secureKeyPair = try SecureECKeyPair.createEcKeyPair()
HashCache.shared.maxCacheSize = 5000
```

### Migration from v1.x:
1. Replace `ECKeyPair` with `SecureECKeyPair`
2. Enable hash caching for performance
3. Review security guide: `docs/SECURITY.md`
4. Follow deployment guide: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### Automatic GitHub Actions:
1. **Release workflow triggers** when tag `v2.0.0` is pushed
2. **Security validation** runs automatically  
3. **Multi-platform builds** create distribution artifacts
4. **GitHub Release** created with comprehensive changelog
5. **Notification systems** alert about the new release

### Manual Steps Required:
- Push the tag to trigger release: `git push origin v2.0.0`
